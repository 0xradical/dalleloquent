# Dalleloquent

Most Anki decks used for language learning focus on
recognition rather than recalling. The former is presenting
a word in your target language and asking you to translate it
to your native language. The latter is about asking you to 
*produce* something in your target language based on input (
an image, video, or a vague description).

As I was having a hard time finding Anki decks in recalling mode,
this project aims to generate Anki cards automatically for the
most common words and expressions used in English using Dall-e and GPT-4,
provided by OpenAPI.
